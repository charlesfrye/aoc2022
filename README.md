Solutions to (some) puzzles from Advent of Code 2022 in three languages:

- **Î» Haskell Î»**, a lazy, declarative functional programming language
- ðŸ¦€ **Rust** ðŸ¦€, a safety-conscious systems programming language
- â˜• **Javascript + Node + TypeScript** â˜•, the contemporary full-stack web dev "language"

It uses devcontainers, the containerization tool for VSCode,
to separate the three languages from each other and to make the solutions more portable.
